        Last year, I watched a movie called <em>Maharaja</em> with a friend. Neither of us expected much at first, 
        but we were both really absorbed by it. The story, acting, and everything about the movie were great, 
        and it turned out to be an unexpected experience. We both enjoyed it a lot, and sharing that moment 
        made it memorable for us.
